## Hi there, welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

My name is Benedikt, I have a background in theoretical physics, and a strong
interest in software development.
I enjoy tinkering with open-source software and personal projects, either to
scratch an itch of mine, or to learn a new language or technology.
Here, you can find a few examples (the links will typically take you to an overview
of my contributions):
<!-- These projects represent my skills at the time they were created, ... -->
<!-- Various states of completion -->

- One of my earliest open-source contributions was to the music library manager
  [beets](https://github.com/beetbox/beets/pulls?q=author%3Awisp3rwind).
  These days, I'm less active contributing to features, but do help with
  maintaining the project and modernizing the code base. (Some of this work
  happened under my previous Github handle, @wordofglass.)
  <!-- Skills: Python + tooling, git, GitHub CI, OSS maintenance ... -->

- As a Fedora/GNOME user, I sometimes help investigate issues or submit the
  occasional bug fix to the [GNOME ecosystem](https://gitlab.gnome.org/users/wisperwind/activity).
  <!-- Could also mention fdo gitlab (currently very few contribs, though) https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/users/wisperwind/activity -->
  <!-- Skills: C, Valgrind, ... -->

- Given my academic background, I've been exposed to LaTeX a lot.
  For a while was quite invested in learning about the new latex3 infrastructure,
  rewriting a few tools using `expl3`, such as [latex-revision](https://git.sr.ht/~wisperwind/latex-revision).
  Nowadays, I'm watching Typst closely, which seems to be the first serious,
  modern contender to LaTeX, even though it hasn't quite reached feature
  parity.
  [typst-scaffolder](https://github.com/wisp3rwind/typst-scaffolder)
  is a small debug helper package I made in this context.
  <!-- Skills: typst, LaTeX + expl3, GitHub actions, ... -->

  <!-- - TODO: digitizer? -->
  <!-- Skills: Rust + FFI, ... -->

- [wifi2qr](https://git.sr.ht/~wisperwind/wifi2qr) is a small tool that I wrote
  to learn some C: It displays QR codes to share WiFi credentials for stored
  NetworkManager connections. This was written before GNOME settings added
  support for the feature.
  <!-- Skills: C, GTK -->

  <!-- - TODO: rootless_wol? -->
  <!-- Skills: Rust, ... -->

- [zotoc](https://github.com/wisp3rwind/zotoc) is a script to add outlines
  to PDFs that lack them, greatly helping with navigating them in Zotero.
  <!-- Skills: Python, ... -->

- For [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/issues?q=is%3Apr%20author%3Awisp3rwind),
  I contributed a few changes that improve reliability and system integration
  on Linux (via Avahi).
  <!-- Skills: Rust, async, DBus/zbus, Avahi ... -->

  <!-- - TODO: mbd? -->
  <!-- - TODO: fsclone? -->

- At some point, I contributed a few small additions to
  [DuckDB](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues?q=is%3Apr%20author%3Awisp3rwind),
  extending the Python API and improving Parquet compression support.
  <!-- Skills: C++, Python -->

- With a few project ideas in mind, I've recently been diving a bit into
  embedded Rust for the ESP32.
  In a bout of over-engineering, I've made a few contributions to the RMT driver in
  [esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/issues?q=author%3Awisp3rwind)
  which helped me blink addressable LED stripes in the most efficient async way.
  <!-- Skills: Rust, embedded, ... -->
  <!-- - TODO: more esp stuff? -->

- Iâ€™m looking into learning a bit of frontend development to broaden
  my skillset, and currently planning to build a small workout timer web app.
  Stay tuned!
  <!-- Skills: Frontend (Vue, Vite, ...) -->

And many more!
